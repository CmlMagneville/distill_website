## mFD R Package and associated tutorials


During my PhD, I have developped the <span style="color: #00cc99;">mFD R package</span> which computes and plots functional diversity indices 📏🎨


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CmlMagneville/mFD/main/man/figures/hexasticker_mFD.png" style="height:140px; width:130px; padding:20px;"/>

It is currently available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mFD/index.html) and [Github](https://github.com/CmlMagneville/mFD) for the development version. 

Its [website](https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/) goes with a set of <span style="color: #00cc99;">tutorials</span> to help to go through the functional analysis process. If you have any question about the use of the *mFD* package, just contact me and I will be happy to help!


## Website on the basics of Code Reproductibility in R

During on a project made during a teaching unit done by the [FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) in Montpellier (December 2021), 
two other PhD students and I have build a website on the basics of Code Reproductibility in R 🚀 Lena Klay, Erwan Harscouet and I hope that this [PokeReproductibility website](https://poke-reproducibility.netlify.app/) can help newcomers in the Reproductibility to understand the key concepts!


## Teaching Material to introduce trait-based diversity to bachelor students using R

In this teaching material led by [Laura Richardson](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/staff/sos/laura-richardson-061068/en), we propose a set of one introductory lecture, three practicals in R and one symposium with a poster session, to learn what is functional diversity, how to compute a multidimensional space based on species traits, diverse functional indices and their meaning, based on an ecological question and field data 🐠🪸

You can find the Teaching material [here](http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v20/issues/data_sets/richardson/abstract.html) !

Using this teaching material, students learn how to:
1- Get to know their dataset & traits data using R 🔎
2- Learn basic operations of data manipulation and plot using the #ggplot2 package 📉
3- Develop hypotheses on coral bleaching's impact on fish FD🪸
4- Learn how to build a multi-traits space via PCoA  & what it represents🚀
5- Compute FD indices & understand their meaning🧠
6- Test their hypotheses using stat tests🧮
7- Present their results in a poster🎆

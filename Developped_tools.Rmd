## mFD R Package and associated tutorials


During my PhD, I have developped the <span style="color: #00cc99;">mFD R package</span> which computes and plot functional diversity indices.

It is currently available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mFD/index.html) and [Github](https://github.com/CmlMagneville/mFD) for the development version. 

Its [website](https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/) goes with a set of <span style="color: #00cc99;">tutorials</span> to help to go through the functional analysis process.

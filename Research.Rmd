<span style="color: #93A588;">DRIVERS OF MEDITERRANEAN FORESTS TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY & ITS EVOLUTION ACROSS FUTURE SCENARIOS (Sept 2023 - Sept 2026)</span>


I am beginning a Postdoc at the [ECONOVO Center](https://bio.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/econovo)
and [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) (Denmark). 
I am studying the relative importance of current and past environmental 
conditions and biotic interactions in shaping taxonomic, functional and 
phylogenetic diversity patterns. Once this knowledge has been acquired, I will
be focusing on how these diversity facets evolve across different
socio-economical scenarios and assessing species vulnerability to land-use and
climate change.

This work is part of the [INTEGRADIV](https://www.integradiv-biodiversa.org/)
Biodiversa project.


<span style="color: #93A588;">FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISHES IN COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY (PhD thesis - 2019 - 2023) </span>

I did my PhD at the [MARBEC lab](https://umr-marbec.fr/en/) at the 
[University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) (France). I 
developped new tools to estimate the temporal variability of fishes diversity
and functional roles based on cameras approaches. Using these tools, I studied 
how functional roles varied at within-day and between-day scales in temperate
and tropical coastal ecosystems. Then, I have assessed how this temporal
variation at short temporal scale can affect our perception of Protected Marine Areas
effect. I have found that within-day and between-day variability in species 
functional roles is high and that functional processes (such as herbivory or 
corallivory) are mainly realised during intense activity events. Thus measuring
functional processes on short temporal scales can biais their estimation.

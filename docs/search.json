These drivers consider past climate stability, habitat characteristics, disturbances and past and present direct human impact.\r\nThen, once the drivers have been highlighted, we will be able to assess the expected trajectories of each diversity facet in a near future (2100) and study how it will impact carbon sequestration.\r\nFinally, we will focus on diversity hotspots and protected areas to understand how current hotspots and protected areas roles will change in the near future, by looking at their role in safeguarding functionally and phylogenetically vulnerable species and ecosystem processes. We plan to build a website to provide stakeholders with results they could use. My work is part of the INTEGRADIV project\r\nThis work is part of the INTEGRADIV\r\nBiodiversa project whose final role is to provide guidelines on how taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of biodiversity could be encapsulated in realistic conservation plans - you can find a video explaining the global aim of the project here.\r\nFor a global summary of the first parts of my project during this postdoc,\r\nyou can have a look at the poster I presented at the IBS 2024 here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISHES IN COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY (PhD thesis - 2019 - 2023) - with Sébastien Villéger and Thomas Claverie. \r\nI did my PhD at the MARBEC lab at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). I\r\ndevelopped new tools to estimate the temporal variability of fishes diversity and functional roles based on long-duration cameras approaches. Using these tools, I studied how functional roles varied at within-day and between-day scales in temperate and tropical coastal ecosystems. Then, I assessed how these temporal variations at short temporal scale can affect our perception of Protected Marine Areas effect.\r\nI have found that within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles is high and that functional processes (such as herbivory or corallivory) are mainly realised during intense activity events. Thus measuring functional processes on short temporal scales can biais their estimation.\r\nMy PhD was filled with different experiences. Methodological work through the development of long-duration underwater cameras, the construction of a metric to better assess mobile species abundance on videos & the lead of the creation of a R package to compute and plot functional diversity indices with a team of researchers. I then applied these tools to collect and analyse data, trying to enhance our understanding of within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles, through fieldwork (Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean) and reproducible analyses in R. I also had the opportunity to work with an incredible team of students, who assisted me in these advancements and with whom I enjoyed sharing skills. This exchange of knowledge and ideas - which goes both ways, is essential to my work, that’s why I also taught courses in statistics and functional ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Once this knowledge has been acquired, I will\r\nbe focusing on how these diversity facets evolve across different\r\nsocio-economical scenarios and assessing species vulnerability to land-use and\r\nclimate change.\r\nThis work is part of the INTEGRADIV\r\nBiodiversa project.\r\nFUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISHES IN COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY (PhD thesis - 2019 - 2023) \r\nI did my PhD at the MARBEC lab at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). I\r\ndevelopped new tools to estimate the temporal variability of fishes diversity\r\nand functional roles based on cameras approaches. Using these tools, I studied\r\nhow functional roles varied at within-day and between-day scales in temperate\r\nand tropical coastal ecosystems. Then, I have assessed how this temporal\r\nvariation at short temporal scale can affect our perception of Protected Marine Areas\r\neffect. I have found that within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles is high and that functional processes (such as herbivory or\r\ncorallivory) are mainly realised during intense activity events. Thus measuring\r\nfunctional processes on short temporal scales can biais their estimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I am supervised by Sébastien Villéger and Thomas Claverie.\r\nI am currently working on marine fish functional diversity and its temporal variation at the within day and between-day scales, using long-duration underwater remote cameras.\r\nDetails: I study the contribution of fish species to ecosystem processes, what we call their functional role. Instead of looking at species richness (number of species in a given location), I am looking at species characteristics (such as their diet, their size …) shaping their role in the environment and also precise processes such as the herbivory activity which shape ecosystem functioning. I am more precisely interested in the temporal variation of this functional diversity as for mobile species, such as fishes, their impact at a given location varies across time (because they move). I apply this framework to study the impact of tropicalisation on functional diversity and the effect of Marine Protected Areas on diversity accumulation through time.\r\nDuring my PhD, I also had the opportunity to realise teaching at the University of Montpellier in Biostatistics, Functional Ecology and R programmation.\r\n“Functional diversity is of ecological importance because it, by definition, is the component of diversity that influences ecosystem dynamics, stability, productivity, nutrient balance, and other aspects of ecosystem functioning.” Tilman, 2001\r\nReferences\r\nTilman, D (2001) Functional Diversity..

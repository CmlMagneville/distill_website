I notably focused on exploring how\r\n            functional processes change over short time periods (within\r\n            and between days) which has led me to contribute to the\r\n            development of underwater long-duration cameras and to the\r\n            creation of a new metric that considers these short-term\r\n            temporal variations.

These drivers consider past climate stability, habitat characteristics, disturbances and past and present direct human impact.\r\nThen, I aim to understand how current protected areas effectiveness will change in a near future (2070), by looking at their role in safeguarding functionally and phylogenetically rare species.\r\nThis work is part of the INTEGRADIV\r\nBiodiversa project whose final role is to provide guidelines on how taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of biodiversity could be encapsulated in realistic conservation plans - you can find a video explaining the global aim of the project here.\r\nFor a global summary of the first parts of my project during this postdoc,\r\nyou can have a look at the poster I presented at the IBS 2024 here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPORAL VARIATION IN TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND NUTRIENT CYCLING OF CONSUMERS ACROSS AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS (Co-PI - 2025-2026) - Co-lead with Dr.¬†Grier (postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara, California, US), Ms.¬†Enright (PhD candidate at UC Santa Barbara), Mr.¬†White (PhD candidate at UC Santa Barbara). \r\nThe goal of this LTER synthesis working group funded by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) (United States) is to understand how the functional diversity of consumers shapes ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, and how this diversity changes over time in response to temperature. By combining long-term population data from LTER sites across ecosystems with trait databases, the team will map consumers across ecosystems in trait space, identify ecological strategies across ecosystems, and assess how biodiversity patterns vary across ecosystems and environmental gradients.\r\nlink to the description of the project on the NCEAS website\r\nPast Projects\r\nFUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISHES IN COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY (PhD thesis - 2019 - 2023) - with S√©bastien Vill√©ger and Thomas Claverie. \r\nI did my PhD at the MARBEC lab at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). I\r\ndevelopped new tools to estimate the temporal variability of fishes diversity and functional roles based on long-duration cameras approaches. Using these tools, I studied how functional roles varied at within-day and between-day scales in temperate and tropical coastal ecosystems. Then, I assessed how these temporal variations at short temporal scale can affect our perception of Protected Marine Areas effect.\r\nI have found that within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles is high and that functional processes (such as herbivory or corallivory) are mainly realized during intense activity events. Thus measuring functional processes on short temporal scales can bias their estimation.\r\nMy PhD was filled with different experiences. Methodological work through the development of long-duration underwater cameras, the construction of a metric to better assess mobile species abundance on videos & the lead of the creation of a R package to compute and plot functional diversity indices with a team of researchers. I then applied these tools to collect and analyse data, trying to enhance our understanding of within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles, through fieldwork (Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean) and reproducible analyses in R. I also had the opportunity to work with an incredible team of students, who assisted me in these advancements and with whom I enjoyed sharing skills. This exchange of knowledge and ideas - which goes both ways, is essential to my work, that‚Äôs why I also taught courses in statistics and functional ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF THREATENED ENDEMIC MAMMAL DIVERSITY ON ISLANDS IN A CONSERVATION CONTEXT (Msc thesis - Jan 2019 - June 2020) - with Camille Leclerc and C√©line Bellard \r\nDuring my Master 2 internship, I worked at the ESE lab in the Biodiversity dynamics and macro-ecology team led by Franck Courchamp. I learned how to use traits to compute functional diversity, and how to compute phylogenetic diversity. I apply these notions, to study the diversity facets of threatened insular endemic mammals to identify priority areas for their conservation. During this internship, I also learned through lab meetings, to see the glass as half full rather than half empty, and to celebrate small successes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

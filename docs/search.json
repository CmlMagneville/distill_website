The complexity of nature is immense, and we\r\nhave only scratched the surface of our understanding of natural ecosystems\r\nfunctioning.\r\nWhen examining a species community, diversity is often measured in terms of\r\nspecies richness, but it can also be observed through the lens of species\r\nfunctional strategies, known as functional diversity.\r\nAs a functional ecologist, my research aims to\r\nincrease our understanding on how ecosystems are functioning and\r\nhow human activity can impact this functioning.\r\nI studied different taxa and scales which has led me to be more motivated by the\r\nresearch question itself rather than by the taxa it applies to. I like to improve\r\nmethodologies to precise species functional role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nDRIVERS OF MEDITERRANEAN FORESTS TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY & ITS EVOLUTION ACROSS FUTURE SCENARIOS (Sept 2023 - Sept 2026)\r\nI am beginning a Postdoc at the ECONOVO Center\r\nand Aarhus University (Denmark).\r\nI am studying the relative importance of current and past environmental\r\nconditions and biotic interactions in shaping taxonomic, functional and\r\nphylogenetic diversity patterns. Once this knowledge has been acquired, I will\r\nbe focusing on how these diversity facets evolve across different\r\nsocio-economical scenarios and assessing species vunerability to land-use and\r\nclimate change.\r\nThis work is part of the INTEGRADIV\r\nBiodiversa project.\r\nFUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISHES IN COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY (PhD thesis - 2019 - 2023) \r\nI did my PhD at the MARBEC lab at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). I\r\ndevelopped new tools to estimate the temporal variability of fishes diversity\r\nand functional roles based on cameras approaches. Using these tools, I studied\r\nhow functional roles varied at within-day and between-day scales in temperate\r\nand tropical coastal ecosystems. Then, I have assessed how this temporal\r\nvariation at short temporal scale can affect our perception of Protected Areas\r\neffect. I have found that within-day and between-day variability in species\r\nfunctional roles is high and that functional processes (such as herbivory or\r\ncorallivory) are mainly realised during intense activity events. Thus measuring\r\nfunctional processes on short temporal scales can biais their estimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

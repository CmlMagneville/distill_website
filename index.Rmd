## Hi! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I have been captivated by nature ever since my childhood, when I first began 
exploring the trails of the Alps. The complexity of nature is immense, and we 
have only scratched the surface of our understanding of how natural ecosystems function.

In scrutinizing species communities, diversity manifests not only in species richness, but also through the perspectives of species functional strategies (known as functional diversity) and evolutionary histories (know as phylogenetic diversity). This **multidimensional view**, encompassing taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversities, forms the basis of my research so far.

My primary focus is on **functional diversity, explored through both the diversity of traits exhibited by species and the study of their activities**. Through my work, I seek to **enhance our understanding of the impact of human activities on ecosystem functioning**. This pursuit drives me to **develop tools** aimed at enhancing our assessment of ecological processes.

I have studied different taxa (marine and terrestrial) and scales (from local to global) which has led me to be more motivated 
by the research question itself rather than by the taxa it applies to. 

Iâ€™d love to hear from you, you can find me online using the links on the left!

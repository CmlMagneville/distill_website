## Hi! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I have been captivated by nature ever since my childhood, when I first began 
exploring the trails of the Alps. The complexity of nature is immense, and we 
have only scratched the surface of our understanding of natural ecosystems
functioning.

When examining a species community, diversity is often measured in terms of 
species richness, but it can also be observed through the lens of species 
functional strategies, known as functional diversity or species phylogenetic 
history, know as phylogenetic diversity.

The main characteristic of my research so far, is to lead a multidimensional 
approach of diversity, considering not only taxonomic diversity but also 
functional and phylogenetic diversities, to study the impact of human
activity on ecosystems. I'm also interested in developing new methodological
approaches to better assess ecosystem functioning.
I have studied different taxa and scales which has led me to be more motivated 
by the research question itself rather than by the taxa it applies to. 

Iâ€™d love to hear from you, you can find me online using the links on the left!

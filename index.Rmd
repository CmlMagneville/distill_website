## Hi!

I am a PhD student at [the MARBEC lab](https://umr-marbec.fr/en/), [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) in France. I am supervised by [Sébastien Villéger](https://umr-marbec.fr/membre/sebastien-villeger/?highlight=villeger) and [Thomas Claverie](https://www.thomasclaverie.fr/).

I am currently working on marine fish <span style="color: #00cc99;">functional diversity</span> and its <span style="color: #00cc99;">temporal variation</span> at the within day and between-day scales, using <span style="color: #00cc99;">long-duration underwater remote cameras</span>. 

Details: I study the contribution of fish species to ecosystem processes, what we call their functional role. Instead of looking at species richness (number of species in a given location), I am looking at <span style="color: #00cc99;">species characteristics (such as their diet, their size …) shaping their role in the environment</span> and also precise processes such as <span style="color: #00cc99;">the herbivory activity</span> which shape ecosystem functioning. I am more precisely interested in the temporal variation of this functional diversity as for mobile species, such as fishes, their impact at a given location varies across time (because they move). I apply this framework to study the impact of <span style="color: #00cc99;">tropicalisation</span> on functional diversity and the <span style="color: #00cc99;">effect of Marine Protected Areas</span> on diversity accumulation through time.


During my PhD, I also had the opportunity to realise <span style="color: #00cc99;">teaching</span> at the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) in Biostatistics, Functional Ecology and R programmation.


*"Functional diversity is of ecological importance because it, by definition, is the component of diversity that influences ecosystem dynamics, stability, productivity, nutrient balance, and other aspects of ecosystem functioning."* [Tilman, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123847195000617)

## Hi! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I have been captivated by nature ever since my childhood, when I first began 
exploring the trails of the Alps. The complexity of nature is immense, and we 
have only scratched the surface of our understanding of natural ecosystems
functioning.

When examining a species community, diversity is often measured in terms of 
species richness, but it can also be observed through the lens of species 
functional strategies, known as functional diversity. 

As a functional ecologist, my research aims to 
increase our understanding on how ecosystems are functioning and 
how human activity impact this functioning.
I have studied different taxa and scales which has led me to be more motivated by the 
research question itself rather than by the taxa it applies to. I like to improve
methodologies to precise species functional role.

Iâ€™d love to hear from you :) You can find me online using the links on the left!
